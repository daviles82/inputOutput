# Overview

This tutorial utilizes unique features in Rust. Basic code is written and read from an external file. Important aspects of this code include the mut keyword and the utilization of the standard library. The library utilizes paths to make the code more efficient. In addition, Rust will notify tools, functions, or packages not used during the compile time.

A software engineer knows how to create software; a good way to test this is by showing others how. A sound engineer can develop and design great software, but he needs to be able to code and explain it consistently. This tutorial is a great way to help others succeed in their eventual journey to software engineering.
